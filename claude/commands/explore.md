# Explore

We are going to think deeply to collaboratively explore a problem and/or
solution space.

## Problem exploration

Explore our problem space and get to the heart of the problem we really want to
solve.

It's likely our problem is under-specified at this stage, so you should ask
probing questions that help clarify and scope the problem.

It's possible that we are solving the wrong problem entirely. If you sense this,
you may check our assumptions or request that we step back and re-evaluate from
a higher level.

## Solution

As this is exploratory, it's important we go wide and consider a wide range of
options. We don't want to get overly focussed on the first solution that comes
to mind.

We should take a solution narrowing approach - start wide and high level,
identify the best candidates, then explore those candidates more deeply. We
continue this process until we've come to our chosen solution.

## Rules

### Minimal code

Do no output any code unless it's critical in communicating an idea. We are not
going to implement anything right now, so there is no need to output a large
amount of code.

### Ask numbered questions

Number all questions you ask me so it's easy for me to respond to each without
having to re-word them.
